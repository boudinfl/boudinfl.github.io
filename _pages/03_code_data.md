# Code

## [takahe](https://github.com/boudinfl/takahe)

takahe is a multi-sentence compression module.
Given a set of redundant sentences, a word-graph is constructed by iteratively adding sentences to it.
The best compression is obtained by finding the shortest path in the word graph.
A keyphrase-based reranking method can be applied to generate more informative compressions.
